## Fursona & Interests

My fursona is a charming snow bunny, and just like a bunny in the wild, I love exploring the vast world of game reversing and game hacking. 🎮❄️

- **Game Reversing**: Just as bunnies dig tunnels, I delve deep into game code to understand its intricacies.

- **Game Hacking**: I'm on a quest to uncover the hidden gems within games, much like a bunny searching for tasty treats.

- **Languages**: I have a soft spot for programming languages:
  - Go: My choice for agile and efficient coding.
  - C++: Perfect for crafting complex and immersive experiences.
  - C#: Ideal for building my own gaming worlds.
  - Python: When I want to add a touch of magic to my projects.
